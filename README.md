# CuckooVM
Cuckoo running in a nested hypervisor!

If you've ever wanted to run Cuckoo but couldn't afford dedicating a full workstation/server/PC for it? Then, here is a solution for that by running Cuckoo in a nested Hypervisor. The VM has been configured to run on VMWare and Cuckoo within this VM will be running VirtualBox to test your samples.

**Download:**
The VM could be found [here](https://archive.org/details/CuckooVM).

**Installation:**
Just import into VMWare (tested), add a Windows System (preferably Windows 7) and run.


Enjoy!
